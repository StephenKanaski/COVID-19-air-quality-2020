Analyzed air quality metrics of four target cities to determine if Covid-19 lockdown procedures impacted overall air quality. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is determined by measuring five major categories of air pollution and placing an overall score to determine impact on human health.
Air Quality Indeces from 2019 were compared with the AQIs of 2020 during lockdown. A comparison of 2019 AQI data and 2020 AQI data showed a marked decrease in Unhealthy to Hazardous days and an increase in Good to Moderate days
Total of constituent pollutants reduced (stacked area charts). The figures below show constituent pollutants in New Delhi during 2019 and 2020:
